## We are Blood Moon PZ

> We are a **group of friends** who put together this Project Zomboid server **for fun**.  
> No corporate backing, no big team—just us building something we enjoy.

We are creating a **custom version** of the Project Zomboid server with **custom mods** and a lot of **enthusiasm**. If you stumble upon our org or our server, welcome.

---

### Behind the scenes

We run **dev**, **staging**, and **production** environments and put real time into keeping everything running and improving.

| Resource | Per month |
| :------- | --------: |
| **Servers** (dev, staging, production) | **$150+** |
| **Senior backend** (2 devs × 8h/day) | **~480 h** |
| **Administration & ops** (3 admins, >10h/day each) | **900+ h** |

*No investors, no sponsors—just us. Every dollar and hour comes from the team.*
